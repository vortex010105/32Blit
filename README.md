# 32Blit
Code snippets, ideas, customizations, and optimizations for the 32Blit and STM32H/F Discovery boards

The 32Bilt is a handheld games console that is being developed by Pimoroni through a Kick Starter campaign, to which I am signed up as a Beta Tester. I am not affliated with Pimoroni in any other way.
